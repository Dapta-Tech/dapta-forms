### Minor Changes

- 9b42f40: Every integration carries its own delivery log, and a delivery can be read back.

  **The failure list was loud in the wrong place.** The Connect tab rendered one
  flat "Deliveries that did not land" block, sitting loose between the integrations
  and Tracking and mixing all four outbox kinds. It answered "something is broken"
  without answering "which of these three integrations", and on a form with a dead
  endpoint its retries pushed Tracking and Emails off the screen — the diagnosis
  was louder than everything it was diagnosing. Each card now owns its history, so
  the reason a webhook is failing is read beside the URL that is failing.

  The log does not live _inside_ the card either. A card is a settings form, and
  twenty-five rows of history in the middle of one buries the endpoint URL the
  reader came for. The card carries a single line — a count, red when something
  failed — and the log opens in a dialog where a long list is free to be long.

  **It is a history, not a failure list.** The queue never deleted its `done` rows;
  nothing had ever asked for them, so a webhook that works and a webhook that has
  never fired looked identical. `listFormDeliveries` takes `kinds` and `statuses`
  (defaulting to the original failures-only answer, so existing callers are
  unaffected), and the `kinds` filter runs in SQL — which is what makes asking for
  landed rows viable at all, since they are most of the table. A new
  `(account_id, kind, updated_at)` index serves that read; the only index this
  table had served the worker's opposite question.

  **Deliveries can now be read back.** Three nullable columns record the request
  body actually sent and the status and body that came back. The enqueued `payload`
  is not those bytes, and only those bytes answer the question every webhook
  debugging session opens with. `NULL` means NOT RECORDED — an older row, or a kind
  whose adapter has no single request to report — never "an empty body was sent".
  Both bodies are truncated on write. An attempt that reports no transcript leaves
  the stored one alone, so the last retry of a host that stopped resolving cannot
  erase what the endpoint used to say.

  **Test deliveries are listed.** The admin's "Send test" is synchronous and never
  passed through the queue, so the log stayed empty during exactly the session it
  exists to help — wiring up an endpoint, when the test is often the only delivery
  that has run. It is a real signed POST, so it is recorded, badged as a test, and
  written already-terminal so the worker can never send it a second time.

  **Email rows can be attributed to a form.** `SubmissionNotification` never
  carried `formId` — it was used to resolve the template and then dropped — so no
  email delivery could be traced to the form that sent it. Additive; rows enqueued
  before this stay unattributable.

- e877d55: Feedback round (V2): graceful variable interpolation (sweeps orphaned
  punctuation when a `[field]` resolves empty); country-code phone input
  (bundled ISO 3166-1 data + E.164 value + subscriber-digit validation);
  branded admin dropdown combobox; account-level integration connect flow with
  AES-256-GCM encrypted-at-rest token storage (`account_integration` table,
  migration 0004, per-account token resolution with env fallback); Typeform-style
  per-form HubSpot mapping with smart auto-map; editable notification email
  templates (subject/body with `{{token}}` interpolation, escaped); webhook
  per-event triggers (`events: partial|complete`); soft banner styling; HubSpot
  booking-embed fallback.
- 310f098: Actually tell someone they were invited, and stop showing them as pending once
  they arrive.

  `inviteMember` inserted a member row with status `invited` and stopped. There
  was no invitation email anywhere in `@quill/notifications` — the invited person
  was simply never told, and the only way in was for an admin to message them
  out of band.

  `renderMemberInvited` (EN + ES) is the copy, `SubmissionNotifier.sendMemberInvited`
  sends it, and the API enqueues it through the outbox like every other
  side-effect — never inline from the request handler, so a mail provider being
  down cannot fail an invite that already succeeded. The notice is anchored on the
  member id, so a retried delivery cannot read as a second invitation. With no
  `PUBLIC_APP_URL` configured the sign-in line is dropped rather than printing a
  broken link.

  The copy stays deliberately plain: it names the workspace, who added them, and
  where to sign in. There is no token and no accept step because none is needed —
  `resolveByEmail` already matches an existing member by address, so signing in
  with the invited email is what binds the account.

  New `activateInvitedMember` flips `invited` → `active` on first resolve.
  Nothing did this before, so someone who accepted stayed "invited" in the members
  list forever and an admin could not tell a pending invite from an active
  teammate. The transition is deliberately narrow — a `disabled` member logging in
  stays disabled, which is the whole point of disabling them, and an already-active
  member is never rewritten.

### Patch Changes

- a6b7fcf: Pilot-port feature set: per-outcome booking embeds (HubSpot Meetings / Calendly) with a booking callback and durable booking→CRM sync via the outbox; answer-forced outcome overrides; reveal screen duration/subtitle templates/prewarm; per-form tracking config (GTM, Meta Pixel, PostHog, HubSpot); HubSpot destination value maps, outcome property, static properties, company inference and bookingSync; draft→publish workflow (form.draft_config/published_at, additive migration 0003 + booking_event table); respondent confirmation email wiring; normalizeConfig now preserves additive top-level config fields; i18n EN+ES for all new surfaces.
