# @quill/notifications

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- e877d55: Feedback round (V2): graceful variable interpolation (sweeps orphaned
  punctuation when a `[field]` resolves empty); country-code phone input
  (bundled ISO 3166-1 data + E.164 value + subscriber-digit validation);
  branded admin dropdown combobox; account-level integration connect flow with
  AES-256-GCM encrypted-at-rest token storage (`account_integration` table,
  migration 0004, per-account token resolution with env fallback); Typeform-style
  per-form HubSpot mapping with smart auto-map; editable notification email
  templates (subject/body with `{{token}}` interpolation, escaped); webhook
  per-event triggers (`events: partial|complete`); soft banner styling; HubSpot
  booking-embed fallback.
- 310f098: Actually tell someone they were invited, and stop showing them as pending once
  they arrive.

  `inviteMember` inserted a member row with status `invited` and stopped. There
  was no invitation email anywhere in `@quill/notifications` — the invited person
  was simply never told, and the only way in was for an admin to message them
  out of band.

  `renderMemberInvited` (EN + ES) is the copy, `SubmissionNotifier.sendMemberInvited`
  sends it, and the API enqueues it through the outbox like every other
  side-effect — never inline from the request handler, so a mail provider being
  down cannot fail an invite that already succeeded. The notice is anchored on the
  member id, so a retried delivery cannot read as a second invitation. With no
  `PUBLIC_APP_URL` configured the sign-in line is dropped rather than printing a
  broken link.

  The copy stays deliberately plain: it names the workspace, who added them, and
  where to sign in. There is no token and no accept step because none is needed —
  `resolveByEmail` already matches an existing member by address, so signing in
  with the invited email is what binds the account.

  New `activateInvitedMember` flips `invited` → `active` on first resolve.
  Nothing did this before, so someone who accepted stayed "invited" in the members
  list forever and an admin could not tell a pending invite from an active
  teammate. The transition is deliberately narrow — a `disabled` member logging in
  stays disabled, which is the whole point of disabling them, and an already-active
  member is never rewritten.

### Patch Changes
